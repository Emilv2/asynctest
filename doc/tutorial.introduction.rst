Introduction
============

Asynctest is a library which extends the standard pacakge :mod:`unittest` to
support asyncio features.

This tutorial aims at gathering examples showing how to use :mod:`asynctest`.
It is not a comprehensive documentation and doesn't explain the concepts of
:mod:`asyncio`.

Some basic patterns of :mod:`unittest` are covered. However, if you are not
familiar with :mod:`unittest`, it's probably a good idea to read its
documentation first.
